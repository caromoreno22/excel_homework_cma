## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals in order to give her an idea of how her fundraising goals for her play *Fever* compared to other plays and their fundraising goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the Outcomes Based on Launch Date table and line chart, it is apparent that summer (May-July) was a season marked by success, with May having the most successful amount of theater projects of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
based on the Outcomes Based on Goals table and line chart, it is easy to see that plays with a budget goal of less than $1000 were the most successful compared to all other goal ranges. It is also easy to see that all plays with a goal range of $45000 to $49999 failed; while unclear if the budget was the reason for it's failure, it is still a very distinct relationship shown in our table and chart.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Along with some of my colleagues, I encountered some problems with my Outcomes Based on Goals data which did not become apparent until I ran my chart and it did not look like the example we were provided. It was not until I saw how it differed from the example, and after inquiring with the rest of my classmates, that I realized my countifs() function was missing a condition. Luckily, comparing my chart with that of my classmates and having the help of our TA, allowed me to identify the problem with my functions as well as a solution to get the appropriate results.   

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
I would conclude that summer is the best season of the year to pitch my theater project with the hopes of it being part of the large group of successful projects during this season. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I would conclude that plas with a goal budget of less than $1000 tend to be more successful, and so while there also other factors that I'm sure come into play, I would still keep this in mind when advising people trying to put on a play.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitations of this dataset are other qualitative factors that affect the data we have already collected. For example, maybe it's important to know if a project is expected to be put on in an outdoor setting. Considering recent global health changes, projects outdoor have increased due to necessity.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
It would be interesting to create a table showing the total amount of time spent on a project using the columns we created with the Date Created and Ended Conversion and include the pledged amount of money and its success. This would be a nice way to visualize the amount of time spent on a project and see if there is any relationship between this and a project's success (ot failure).
